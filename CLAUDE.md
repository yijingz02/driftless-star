## Part 1: StellaForge Project

### Project Description

StellaForge is an open-source pipeline for stellarator design, connecting five physics stages (equilibrium, Boozer transform, neoclassical transport, turbulence, and profile evolution) into a single reproducible workflow. The current goal is a working forward pass: from boundary Fourier coefficients and profile guesses through to transport-consistent profiles and fusion-power metrics. The pipeline is designed to be closed-loop, so output profiles can eventually feed back to Stage 1 for iterative optimization.

StellaForge is a **recipe repo**: it contains environment definitions, container builds, and orchestration logic, but the upstream solver codes are installed as dependencies. The companion `stellarator_workflow/` submodule contains TeX manuscripts defining the physics equations and I/O contracts. See `docs/guide.md` for the full pipeline design and contributor workflow.

### The 5 Pipeline Stages

| Stage | Name | Primary Code | Alternatives | Spec |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------|------|
| 1 | Equilibrium | `vmec_jax`, `DESC` | `VMEC++` | `docs/stage1-equilibrium/spec.md` |
| 2 | Boozer Transform | `booz_xform_jax` | `BOOZ_XFORM` | `docs/stage2-boozer/spec.md` |
| 3 | Neoclassical | `NEO_JAX`, `sfincs_jax` / `monkes` | `NEO`, `SFINCS` | `docs/stage3-neoclassical/spec.md` |
| 4 | Turbulence | `SPECTRAX-GK` | `GX`, `GENE` | `docs/stage4-turbulence/spec.md` |
| 5 | Transport | `NEOPAX` | `Trinity3D` | `docs/stage5-transport/spec.md` |

Forward-pass chain: `vmec_jax` -> `booz_xform_jax` -> (`sfincs_jax` / `monkes`) -> `SPECTRAX-GK` -> `NEOPAX`

**Key notes:**
- `NEO_JAX` is **not** in the forward-pass chain. It computes epsilon_eff as a screening/optimization diagnostic only and does not feed Stage 5.
- `sfincs_jax` and `monkes` are **alternatives**, not parallel. Only one is needed: `sfincs_jax` provides full drift-kinetic fluxes while `monkes` provides a monoenergetic D_ij database. Either can feed `NEOPAX` (Stage 5).
- `NEO_JAX` runs independently alongside whichever of `sfincs_jax` / `monkes` is selected.
- Stages 3 and 4 run in parallel after Stage 2.

### Naming Conventions

- Stage directories: `stage{N}-{name}` (e.g., `stage1-equilibrium`)
- Per-stage data subdirectories (under `mvp/stage{N}-{name}/`): `expected_input/` and `expected_output/` hold tracked reference data; `input/` and `output/` are runtime working directories (gitignored). Seed `input/` via `pixi run initialize-example-inputs`.
- Container images: `ghcr.io/rkhashmani/stellaforge:stage-{N}-{code}-cpu` / `stage-{N}-{code}-gpu` (e.g., `stage-1-vmec-cpu`) (on GHCR)
- W&B projects: `stellaforge-stage{N}-{name}`
- Output directories: `{run_dir}/stage{N}_{name}/`
- Test files: mirror source structure in `tests/`

### Inter-Stage Contracts

Currently, most inter-stage communication is **file-based** using standard physics file formats:
- **NetCDF** (`.nc`): equilibrium (`wout_*.nc`), Boozer (`boozmn_*.nc`), turbulence outputs
- **HDF5** (`.h5`): neoclassical outputs (`sfincsOutput.h5`), `monkes` D_ij databases, `NEOPAX` profiles

Snakemake rules define which files connect which stages. Each stage's `spec.md` is the authoritative source for required/optional fields in its output files. Where alternative implementations use different file formats or field names, a wrapper or adapter layer will be needed to translate between them.

**Key points from the TeX manuscripts:**

1. **Screening-only outputs vs. transport state variables.** `NEO_JAX`'s epsilon_eff is central to ranking candidate geometries but is NOT advanced by a transport solver. It should not be wired as a transport input.
2. **Dual-role outputs.** Heat/particle flux from `SPECTRAX-GK` and neoclassical flux from `SFINCS` are simultaneously optimization objectives (to minimize) AND direct numerical inputs for transport profile evolution.
3. **`monkes` -> `NEOPAX` handoff.** `NEOPAX`'s database reader consumes a reduced subset of the `monkes` D_ij HDF5 output (`D11`, `D13`, `D33`, `Er`, `Er_tilde`, `drds`, `rho`, `nu_v`). Agreement on exact field names and shapes is required.
4. **Turbulence coupling.** `NEOPAX` has turbulence-coupling utilities, but the public examples center on the neoclassical reduced model from `monkes`. The `SPECTRAX-GK` -> `NEOPAX` path (Stage 4 -> Stage 5) is not yet the default.

### Working with This Codebase

- Read `docs/guide.md` first for the big picture and contributor workflow.
- Read `docs/mvp-pipeline.md` for MVP I/O reference, Pixi install/run commands.
- Each stage has its own spec in `docs/stage{N}-{name}/spec.md`.
- See `docs/container-images.md` for Docker/Apptainer build and run examples.
- See `docs/potential_issues.md` for known cross-stage compatibility issues.
- The `stellarator_workflow/` submodule is read-only reference material:
  - `stellarator_workflow.tex` -- governing equations and code details
  - `stellarator_io_reference.tex` -- I/O contracts and handoff specifications
- When modifying a stage, consult its spec doc for I/O contracts.

### Phase-Specific Rules

- **Phase 1 (Document & Run):** Install and run the primary code, document the API and convergence behavior, write example scripts, set up W&B tracking. No cross-stage Python imports: all inter-stage communication is through files (e.g. NetCDF/HDF5). This is necessary to maintain swappability. Do not restructure upstream code.
- **Phase 2 (Containerize & Test):** Build container environments, write unit/regression/integration tests. Container changes must pass integration tests before merge. See `docs/guide.md#container-architecture` for the Pixi + Dockerfile approach.
- **Phase 3 (Integrate):** Snakemake rules should support config-driven implementation selection. Stages 3 and 4 run in parallel after Stage 2. `NEO_JAX`'s epsilon_eff is a screening metric only -- it should not be wired as a dependency for Stage 5.

## Part 2: Workflow Standards

### Planning

- Always use plan mode before changes that touch critical or complex logic (e.g., core algorithms, data pipelines, model architectures, mathematical computations).
- When something goes sideways during implementation, stop and re-plan -- don't keep pushing down a broken path.
- During planning, ask as many clarifying questions as needed to fully understand the relevant parts of the codebase, the current system, and how the proposed change fits in. Do not proceed with a plan until ambiguities are resolved.

### Review & Validation

- Act as a critical reviewer: challenge the user's reasoning, flag edge cases, and identify potential issues before implementation begins.
- After implementation, prove the changes work -- diff behavior between the working branch and `main`, run tests, and demonstrate correctness rather than just asserting it.
- Do not create a PR or propose merging until you can show evidence that the changes are correct and complete.

### Testing

- Every new feature or behavior change must include corresponding tests that verify it works as expected. Write tests alongside (or before) the implementation, not as an afterthought.
- Run the project's test suite after making changes to verify nothing is broken.

## Part 3: Scientific Programming Standards

### Reproducibility

- Always seed all RNG sources together so results are deterministic (e.g., `random.seed()`, `np.random.seed()`, `jax.random.PRNGKey()`, and any framework-specific seeds).
- Disable non-deterministic backend behavior for reproducible runs; only enable stochastic optimizations when explicitly trading reproducibility for speed.
- Save full configuration alongside every output so any result can be reproduced (e.g., save args/config to JSON next to output files).
- Default random seed to a deterministic value so runs are reproducible without explicit `--seed`.
- Never use truly random seeds unless explicitly requested by the user.

### Code Quality & Style

- Use the project's configured linter/formatter (e.g., ruff, black). Follow PEP 8 with 120-char line width for Python.
- Add type hints to all new/modified function signatures (parameters + return type).
- Use descriptive names; single-letter math variables (A, Sigma, z) are acceptable when they match paper notation -- add a comment referencing the equation/section.
- Keep functions under 60 lines and ~5 parameters. Extract helpers for longer functions.
- Eliminate code duplication: if the same logic appears twice, factor it into a shared function.
- Never control behavior by commenting/uncommenting code -- use flags or config parameters.
- Prefer f-strings for string formatting in Python.

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all mathematical/numerical functions using the project's test framework (e.g., pytest).
- Test mathematical invariants (e.g., non-negativity constraints, matrix properties like positive semi-definiteness, correct output dimensions).
- For numerical functions, test against known analytical solutions where available.
- Use regression tests: save known-good outputs and compare with explicit tolerances (e.g., `np.testing.assert_allclose`).
- Place tests in a top-level `tests/` directory mirroring the source structure.

### Documentation

- Favor simplicity. State information once in the most appropriate location and reference it elsewhere rather than repeating it. If something is already documented in another file, link to it instead of duplicating.
- Add docstrings to all new/modified public functions using NumPy-style format (Parameters, Returns, Notes).
- For new docstrings, do not reformat existing docstrings in a different style unless modifying the function.
- Include mathematical context in docstrings: reference paper equations/sections where applicable.
- Every module should have a module-level docstring explaining its role in the system.
- Config/argument files should be self-documenting via comments.

### Logging & Error Handling

- Use Python's `logging` module with `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` for all output in production code paths.
- `print()` is acceptable only in debug blocks and CLI entry points (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
- Use typed exceptions with descriptive messages for input validation (e.g., `raise ValueError(...)`, `raise TypeError(...)`). Never bare `assert` for user-facing checks.
- Never silently swallow exceptions. Always log or re-raise caught exceptions.
- Validate data shapes/dimensions at function boundaries when they are non-obvious.

### Numerical Best Practices

- Use library-provided linear algebra functions over manual implementations (e.g., `jax.numpy.linalg`, `numpy.linalg`, `scipy.linalg`).
- Validate mathematical properties of inputs before use (e.g., positive-definiteness of covariance matrices via Cholesky).
- Propagate device and dtype from input data -- never hardcode device or precision (e.g., avoid `device='cuda'` or `dtype=jnp.float32`).
- Use higher precision for computations where numerical accuracy matters (e.g., float64 for information-theoretic or covariance calculations).
- Guard against numerical edge cases: division by zero, log(0), overflow in exp(), and similar.

### Project Organization

- All packages must have proper `__init__.py` files.
- Use proper package imports; avoid path-manipulation hacks (e.g., `sys.path.append()`).
- Scripts should be runnable from the project root, not require `cd` into a subdirectory.
- Keep distinct concerns (data processing, model architecture, training, visualization) as independent modules.

### Version Control

- Make small, focused commits with descriptive messages.
- Save argument files and config alongside results for traceability.
- Never commit large binary files (model checkpoints, datasets) or secrets. Use `.gitignore` appropriately.

### Data Management

- Save raw data separately from processed results.
- Document output formats: array shapes, value ranges, and units in docstrings or project docs.
- Use structured, self-describing formats with descriptive field names (e.g., `.npz` with named arrays, HDF5 with labeled datasets).

### Configuration Management

- All runtime behavior must be controllable via CLI arguments or config files -- never require editing source code.
- Save complete configuration alongside outputs for every run.

## Part 4: Software Engineering Standards

### Dependency Management

- Pin all dependencies with version bounds (e.g., `>=1.0,<2`); avoid unpinned or `*` versions.
- Commit lockfiles for reproducible installs (e.g., `pixi.lock`, `uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`).
- Keep dependency specs consistent across all environment/packaging files when adding or updating packages.
- Separate dev-only dependencies (testing, linting tools) from core dependencies using optional dependency groups.

### Security

- Never hardcode secrets, API keys, or credentials -- use environment variables or config files.
- Never use `eval()`, `exec()`, or unsafe deserialization on untrusted data.
- Use safe loading modes when available (e.g., `torch.load(..., weights_only=True)`); document the reason when unsafe loading is necessary.
- Validate and sanitize all external inputs (CLI args, file paths, JSON) before use.
- Prefer safe subprocess invocation (e.g., `subprocess.run()` with list args); never use `shell=True` with user-provided input.

### CI/CD & Automation

- Configure CI to run linting, type checking, and tests on pull requests.
- Use pre-commit hooks for formatting and linting before commit.
- Automate repetitive workflows via scripts, not manual multi-step commands.

### Docker & Containerization

- Pin base image versions to specific tags, not `latest`.
- Add `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files from the build context.
- Keep Dockerfiles minimal -- install only production dependencies.

**StellaForge container architecture** (see `docs/guide.md#container-architecture` for full details):
- All dependencies are managed through Pixi (e.g., `mvp/pixi.toml` + `mvp/pixi.lock`).
- A single templated Dockerfile (e.g., `mvp/Dockerfile`) builds all stages using `ghcr.io/prefix-dev/pixi:noble` as the base image. Build arguments (`ENVIRONMENT`, `CUDA_VERSION`) select the target stage and GPU support.
- Container images are published to GHCR as `ghcr.io/rkhashmani/stellaforge:stage-{N}-{code}-cpu` / `stage-{N}-{code}-gpu` (e.g., `stage-1-vmec-cpu`). CI builds all stage variants from the single Dockerfile using a GitHub Actions matrix.
- Source-built upstream packages are pinned to exact git commit SHAs in `pixi.toml`.

### Performance & Memory Management

- Disable gradient computation for all inference and evaluation code paths (e.g., `jax.jit` with no grad, `torch.no_grad()`).
- Use mixed precision when memory is a concern.
- Release memory between intensive phases.
- Profile before optimizing -- use profiling tools to identify actual bottlenecks before making performance changes.
