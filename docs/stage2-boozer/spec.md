# Stage 2: Boozer Transform

## Overview

Transforms a VMEC-style equilibrium into Boozer coordinates. Boozer coordinates are the standard system for neoclassical analysis because the magnetic field takes a particularly simple covariant form: the covariant components $I(\psi)$ and $G(\psi)$ are flux-surface functions, not angle-dependent. This stage is a coordinate-transformation step, not a physics solver.

**Position in pipeline:** Receives `wout_*.nc` from Stage 1 (Equilibrium). Outputs `boozmn_*.nc` consumed by Stage 3 (Neoclassical) and indirectly by Stage 4/5.

**Reference:** `stellarator_workflow.tex`, Section 4.3.

## Codes

### booz_xform_jax (Primary JAX)

- **Repository:** <https://github.com/uwplasma/boozx>
- **Language:** Python/JAX
- **Notes:** Also accepts in-memory wout-like objects, enabling a fully differentiable Stage 1 -> Stage 2 path without writing an intermediate NetCDF file.

### BOOZ_XFORM (Legacy)

- **Repository:** <https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/booz_xform>
- **Language:** Fortran/Python
- **Notes:** Standard legacy tool used by the stellarator-optimization community.

### Installation & Platform

**`booz_xform` (legacy Fortran/Python):** Install via the Pixi environment. From inside `mvp/`:

```
pixi install --environment stage-2-booz
```

**`booz_xform_jax`:** Install via the Pixi environment. From inside `mvp/`:

```
pixi install --environment stage-2-booz-jax
```

See `docs/mvp-pipeline.md` for run commands and I/O details.

## Input Specification

Reference: `stellarator_io_reference.tex`, Section 3.2.

| Field | Type | Description | Source |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| `wout_*.nc` | NetCDF file | Full VMEC equilibrium output | Stage 1 |

The JAX version (`booz_xform_jax`) does not use a separate `in_booz.*` control file. Resolution (mboz, nboz) and surface selection are specified via the Python API. The legacy `BOOZ_XFORM` uses an `in_booz.*` control file.

`booz_xform_jax` also accepts in-memory wout-like objects directly from Stage 1, bypassing file I/O.

### Input Validation

> [!TODO]
> See [I/O Validation section](../guide.md#io-validation).

## Output Specification

Reference: `stellarator_io_reference.tex`, Section 3.2.

### Subset Handed to Next Stage

`NEO` and `NEO_JAX` need the Boozer spectrum and radial profiles. `SFINCS`/`sfincs_jax` use the same Boozer geometry. `monkes` and `NEOPAX` use the Boozer spectrum through direct field or file readers.

### Outputs Used as Objectives

Non-target Boozer harmonics in `bmnc_b` or symmetry-breaking measures built from them. These are **geometry diagnostics**, not transport state variables. Typical objectives include:

- Quasi-symmetry residual: sum of unwanted harmonics relative to the dominant mode.
- Mirror ratio and helical content derived from the Boozer spectrum.

### Output Validation

## Governing Equations

Boozer coordinates satisfy the following dual representation of the magnetic field.

**Contravariant form:**

$$\mathbf{B} = \nabla\psi \times \nabla\theta_B + \iota(\psi)\,\nabla\zeta_B \times \nabla\psi$$

**Covariant form:**

$$\mathbf{B} = \beta\,\nabla\psi + I(\psi)\,\nabla\theta_B + G(\psi)\,\nabla\zeta_B$$

The key property of Boozer coordinates is that $I$ and $G$ are flux-surface functions (depend only on $\psi$, not on the angles). This simplifies the magnetic field strength to a pure Fourier series in $(\theta_B, \zeta_B)$ on each surface.

The Boozer angles are defined relative to the VMEC angles by:

$$\zeta_B = \zeta_0 + \nu$$

$$\theta_B = \theta_0 + \lambda + \iota\,\nu$$

The angle-shift field $\nu$ is determined from the covariant field components. The implementation uses:

$$\nu = \frac{w - I\,\lambda}{G + \iota\, I}$$

where $w$ is reconstructed from the original covariant field harmonics.

## Convergence & Validity

> [!TODO]
> Document convergence behavior vs. mboz/nboz resolution, known failure modes, and recommended settings for production vs. screening.

---

## API Documentation

> [!TODO]
> Document the booz_xform_jax Python API: entry points, file-based and in-memory calling conventions, and configuration options.

---

## Scripts & Workflows

**`booz_xform` (via Pixi):** From inside `mvp/`:

```
pixi run stage-2-booz
```

Smoke-test task: verifies the `booz_xform` package is importable. A full end-to-end example for the legacy code is TBD.

**`booz_xform_jax` (via Pixi):** From inside `mvp/`:

```
pixi run -e stage-2-booz-jax stage-2-booz
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Stage 2 JAX driver now takes explicit `--wout` and `--output` paths. Populate `stage1-equilibrium/output/` by running `pixi run stage-1-vmec`, or by copying the reference wout from `stage1-equilibrium/expected_output/`.

**Input:** `mvp/stage1-equilibrium/output/wout_HSX_QHS_vacuum_ns201.nc` (from Stage 1)
**Output:** `mvp/stage2-boozer/output/boozmn_HSX_QHS_vacuum_ns201.nc`

See `docs/mvp-pipeline.md` for full I/O details.
